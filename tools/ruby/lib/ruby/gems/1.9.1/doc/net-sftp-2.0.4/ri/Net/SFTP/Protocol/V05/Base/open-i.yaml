The <tt>flags</tt> parameter is either an integer (in which case it must be a combination of the IO constants) or a string (in which case it must be one of the mode strings that IO::open accepts). The <tt>options</tt> parameter is a hash that is used to construct a new Attribute object, to pass as part of the FXP_OPEN request.
