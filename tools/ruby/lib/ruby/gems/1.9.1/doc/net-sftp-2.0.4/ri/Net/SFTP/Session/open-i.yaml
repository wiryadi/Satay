- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Opens a file on the remote server. The <tt>flags</tt> parameter determines how the flag is open, and accepts the same format as IO#open (e.g., either a string like &quot;r&quot; or &quot;w&quot;, or a combination of the IO constants). The <tt>options</tt> parameter is a hash of attributes to be associated with the file, and varies greatly depending on the SFTP protocol version in use, but some (like :permissions) are always available.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: "Returns immediately with a Request object. If a block is given, it will be invoked when the server responds, with a Response object as the only parameter. The :handle property of the response is the handle of the opened file, and may be passed to other methods (like #close, #read, #write, and so forth)."
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::VERB 
  :body: "  sftp.open(&quot;/path/to/file&quot;) do |response|\n    raise &quot;fail!&quot; unless response.ok?\n    sftp.close(response[:handle])\n  end\n  sftp.loop\n"
