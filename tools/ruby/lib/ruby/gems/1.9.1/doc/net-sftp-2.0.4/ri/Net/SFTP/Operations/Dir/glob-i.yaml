- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Works as ::Dir.glob, matching (possibly recursively) all directory entries under <tt>path</tt> against <tt>pattern</tt>. If a block is given, matches will be yielded to the block as they are found; otherwise, they will be returned in an array when the method finishes.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Because working over an SFTP connection is always going to be slower than working purely locally, don't expect this method to perform with the same level of alacrity that ::Dir.glob does; it will work best for shallow directory hierarchies with relatively few directories, though it should be able to handle modest numbers of files in each directory.
